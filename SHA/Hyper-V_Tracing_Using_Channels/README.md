## Hyper-V_Tracing_Using_Channels

### Description

It can be usefull when a scenario is too long to fit in the VMLTrace buffer

### How it works
This script will do these actions (by default)
* Sets registry keys for verbose tracing and restart VMMS
* Enables the channels according to the OS version (RS1, RS5) and sets their size to 50 MB
* Waits for key pressed
* Stops & Exports the channels
* Evenutally adds the Hyper-V configuration, ClusDB & Cluster logs
* Compresses everything in a .zip file
* Resets the registry keys to default and restart VMMS
